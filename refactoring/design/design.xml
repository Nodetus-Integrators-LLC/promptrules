<rubric>
  <criterion name="Color Palette">
    <grade level="F">Colors are incoherent and clashing; contrast is poor, completely failing to support readability or brand identity</grade>
    <grade level="D">Poor color choices with significant contrast issues; colors appear uncoordinated and disjointed from the brand</grade>
    <grade level="C">A basic, functional palette that meets minimum standards but lacks intentionality and depth</grade>
    <grade level="B">A thoughtful, well-coordinated palette that supports brand identity; minor contrast or variety issues may be present</grade>
    <grade level="A">Exceptional and innovative use of color that enhances user experience, perfectly reflects the brand, and meets all accessibility guidelines</grade>
  </criterion>

  <criterion name="Layout & Grid">
    <grade level="F">Layout is chaotic and lacks any structure or grid, resulting in a disorganized interface</grade>
    <grade level="D">Weak structure with an inconsistent or poorly applied grid; elements seem randomly placed and confusing</grade>
    <grade level="C">An adequate layout that uses a basic grid system; content is organized, though misalignments or inconsistencies are evident</grade>
    <grade level="B">A well-structured layout with a clear grid system that logically organizes content; only minor deviations exist</grade>
    <grade level="A">Masterful use of layout and grid, creating flawless organization and balance that significantly enhances usability and aesthetics</grade>
  </criterion>

  <criterion name="Typography">
    <grade level="F">Typography is haphazard with mismatched fonts; legibility is compromised and no clear hierarchy exists</grade>
    <grade level="D">Inconsistent type choices undermine readability and fail to establish a clear hierarchy, leaving the design unpolished</grade>
    <grade level="C">Functional typography that is legible with a basic hierarchy, yet lacks nuance or consistent style</grade>
    <grade level="B">Strong typography with clear hierarchy and well-chosen typefaces that enhance readability and support the brand identity</grade>
    <grade level="A">Exceptional typography that is both innovative and timeless, offering a compelling hierarchy and impeccable legibility</grade>
  </criterion>

  <criterion name="Hierarchy & Navigation">
    <grade level="F">No clear visual hierarchy; navigation is confusing or missing, leaving users overwhelmed and lost</grade>
    <grade level="D">Weak hierarchy with an unclear navigation structure that forces users to struggle to find essential information</grade>
    <grade level="C">A basic hierarchy that makes navigation serviceable, though it may not optimally guide users through the content</grade>
    <grade level="B">A clear and intuitive hierarchy paired with well-organized navigation that enables users to quickly locate key elements</grade>
    <grade level="A">Superior hierarchy and navigation that intuitively guide users, anticipate needs, and deliver a seamless, engaging journey</grade>
  </criterion>

  <criterion name="Accessibility">
    <grade level="F">The design completely disregards accessibility standards, making it unusable for users with disabilities</grade>
    <grade level="D">Minimal accessibility considerations result in significant barriers; many standards are unmet</grade>
    <grade level="C">Meets basic accessibility standards, ensuring usability for most users but lacking in comprehensive features</grade>
    <grade level="B">Proactive accessibility measures are in place with most guidelines met; only minor issues remain</grade>
    <grade level="A">Exemplary adherence to accessibility guidelines, employing inclusive design practices that ensure full usability for all users</grade>
  </criterion>

  <criterion name="Redundancy">
    <grade level="F">Redundancy is either excessive—leading to clutter—or completely missing, causing confusion and miscommunication</grade>
    <grade level="D">Poorly managed repetition results in either too little reinforcement of key elements or an overwhelming duplication that hinders clarity</grade>
    <grade level="C">Some intentional redundancy exists, but its application is inconsistent, leaving the design feeling unbalanced</grade>
    <grade level="B">Thoughtful redundancy reinforces important elements effectively without overwhelming the interface</grade>
    <grade level="A">Optimal use of redundancy, with strategic repetition that creates familiarity, reinforces key messages, and guides user behavior seamlessly</grade>
  </criterion>

  <criterion name="Spacing & Alignment">
    <grade level="F">Spacing and alignment are severely off; elements are randomly placed, creating visual disarray and impairing readability</grade>
    <grade level="D">Inconsistent spacing and poor alignment contribute to a disjointed appearance that detracts from the overall design</grade>
    <grade level="C">Basic spacing and alignment are maintained, making the design functional, though it lacks refinement and precision</grade>
    <grade level="B">Consistent and well-considered spacing and alignment yield a balanced and visually pleasing layout with only minor issues</grade>
    <grade level="A">Flawless spacing and alignment enhance visual rhythm and harmony, elevating the design to a professional, polished level</grade>

      <description>Navigation bar with poor contrast and confusing layout</description>

        <navbar style="background: #f0f0f0;">
          <link style="color: #e0e0e0;">Home</link>

        </navbar>
      </code>
    </input>
    <chain_of_thought>
      <step>1. Identify issues: Poor contrast (light gray on light background), no visual hierarchy</step>
      <step>2. Apply rubric: Color Palette = F, Typography = D, Hierarchy = F</step>
      <step>3. Solution: Increase contrast, establish hierarchy with font weights, improve spacing</step>
    </chain_of_thought>
