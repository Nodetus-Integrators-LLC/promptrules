# PromptRules

A collection of guidelines, rules, and strategies for optimizing AI interactions.

## Overview

PromptRules provides structured approaches to improve AI outputs through:
- Defined guidelines for prompt engineering
- RAG data and embeddings optimizations
- Cursor rules and command patterns
- System-level instructions and formatting conventions

## Rule Vectors

### Prompt Engineering Rules
- Instruction clarity standards
- Context provision frameworks
- Output formatting requirements
- Chain-of-thought triggers
- Few-shot learning templates

### Cursor Rules
- Command completion formats
- Response behavior modifiers
- Tone and style directives
- Error handling preferences
- Memory utilization guidelines

### RAG Optimization
- Embedding construction patterns
- Retrieval strategy rules
- Context window utilization
- Document chunking standards
- Relevance weighting protocols

### System Instructions
- Agent behavior parameters
- Tool utilization protocols
- Safety guardrail frameworks
- Multi-agent coordination rules
- Response moderation guidelines

### Language Rigidity
- Strict semantic frameworks
- Domain-specific terminologies
- Context-sensitive language patterns
- Precision vs generalization balances
- Translation and interpretation rules

### UX/UI Integration
- Command center interaction designs
- Mobile vs desktop optimization
- Visual cue integration with language models
- Error message standardization
- Progressive disclosure frameworks

## Usage

Apply these rules by:
1. Including them in system prompts
2. Embedding them in RAG systems
3. Implementing them in frontend interfaces
4. Training models with rule-aware fine-tuning
5. Building middleware that enforces rule compliance

## Contribution

Add rules by creating a PR with your additions in the appropriate directory:
- Follow the established format
- Include examples of both rule compliance and violations
- Document expected outcomes
- Cross-reference related rules
