# [NATURAL READING, DIGITAL PAPER]

# Daylight Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create a reading-focused interface that emulates natural ink on paper with selective color highlights
* **Constraint Parameters**: Optimize for readability, reduce eye strain, support extended reading sessions
* **Reference Context**: Kindle e-readers with enhanced color capabilities, physical books with highlight markers
* **Edge Case Handling**: Maintain readability in various lighting conditions, provide adequate contrast in monochromatic mode
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Reading comfort over extended periods, ease of content navigation, highlight effectiveness

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary palette: Monochromatic (paper white to charcoal)
  - Accent palette: Watercolor/marker bursts (muted, translucent colors)
  - Typography: Serif for body text, sans-serif for UI elements
  - Voice/tone: Quiet, calming, reflective

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - Target 60fps scrolling performance
  - Support for e-ink and standard displays
  - Responsive design from 6" to 12" displays
  - Battery-efficient rendering

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA compliance minimum
  - Adjustable text sizing (14-32pt)
  - Variable contrast settings
  - Support for screen readers

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Framework agnostic
  - Minimal JavaScript requirements
  - Progressively enhanced from core reading experience

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - IF nighttime OR low-light THEN activate sepia/dark mode
  - IF extended reading THEN gradually reduce UI element visibility
  - IF highlight density > 30% THEN switch to selective highlighting
  - IF screen size < 7" THEN simplify margin annotations

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Text readability
  2. Reading position maintenance
  3. Highlight visibility
  4. Navigation controls
  5. Supplementary features

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Clean, readable text display
  - Enhanced: Color highlights and annotations
  - Advanced: Interactive notes and references

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - When color unavailable: Use texture patterns for highlighting
  - When JavaScript unavailable: Provide static page navigation
  - When custom fonts unavailable: Optimize system serif fonts

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Reading Comfort (1-5)
* 1: Causes eye strain within minutes
* 3: Comfortable for 30-60 minute reading sessions
* 5: Comfortable for multi-hour reading without fatigue

### Navigation Intuitiveness (1-5)
* 1: Navigation controls confusing or intrusive
* 3: Basic navigation is clear but advanced features require learning
* 5: Intuitive navigation for all reading patterns, nearly invisible UI

### Highlight Effectiveness (1-5)
* 1: Highlights distract from reading experience
* 3: Highlights visible without disrupting flow
* 5: Highlights enhance comprehension without any negative impact

### Adaptability (1-5)
* 1: Works only in ideal lighting conditions
* 3: Adapts to common lighting variations
* 5: Excellent reading experience across all environments

### Aesthetic Fidelity (1-5)
* 1: Digital appearance with no paper-like qualities
* 3: Convincing paper simulation in controlled settings
* 5: Consistently evokes physical reading experience across all contexts

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**: 
  - Users can read continuously for 90+ minutes without reported eye strain
  - 90% of users can locate highlighted sections within 5 seconds
  - Text contrast ratio meets 7:1 in all lighting conditions

* **User Testing Requirements**: 
  - Test with both casual and power readers
  - Include users over 40 (presbyopia)
  - Test across multiple real-world lighting environments

* **Iteration Triggers**: 
  - Reading comprehension tests show <90% effectiveness compared to control
  - User satisfaction ratings fall below 4.2/5
  - Session duration averages less than 25 minutes

* **Documentation Standards**: 
  - Provide color interaction guidelines for content creators
  - Include performance optimization techniques
  - Document accessibility implementation details
