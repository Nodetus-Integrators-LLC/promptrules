# [RAW AESTHETICS, BOLD CONTRASTS, TACTILE DIMENSION]

# Claymorphism Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create tactile, playful interfaces with clay-like dimensional elements that appear soft and squeezable
* **Constraint Parameters**: Must maintain usability while incorporating significant depth and shadow effects
* **Reference Context**: See Cuberto, Stripe interfaces, and Apple's Big Sur aesthetic for dimensional inspiration
* **Edge Case Handling**: Define simplified variations for performance-critical or mobile contexts
* **Evaluation Metrics**: User engagement, perceived playfulness, and recognition of interactive elements

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Colors: Saturated base colors with 15-20% white overlay for "clay" effect
  - Typography: Extra-bold sans-serif (minimum 700 weight) for headers, high-contrast for readability
  - Spacing: Minimum 24px between elements to accommodate dimension effects

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - CSS: Heavy reliance on box-shadow (minimum triple shadow layering)
  - Performance: Optimize shadow rendering for 60fps minimum on mid-tier devices
  - Responsive: Reduce shadow complexity at <768px viewport width

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - Maintain WCAG AA contrast between text and background despite soft shadows
  - Provide non-motion alternatives when clay elements animate on interaction
  - Ensure focus states maintain visibility despite dimensional effects

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - All effects must be achievable with CSS only (no images for basic shapes)
  - No dependency on JavaScript for core visual presentation

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - IF element is interactive THEN clay effect must be at least 8px deep
  - IF background is light THEN shadows must use 8-12% opacity
  - IF background is dark THEN use 15-20% lighter tones for clay elements

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  - 1. Functional clarity
  - 2. Dimensional consistency
  - 3. Performance optimization
  - 4. Animation enrichment

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Base layer: Solid colors with border-radius
  - Enhanced: Multiple layered shadows
  - Full experience: Hover/focus state animations that change dimension

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Degrade to flat design with bold outlines when rendering issues occur
  - Use solid colors with higher contrast when shadow effects cannot be rendered

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Dimensionality (1-5)
* 1: Flat appearance without clay-like qualities
* 3: Some dimension but inconsistent depth perception
* 5: Perfect clay-like appearance with consistent physics across interface

### Tactility (1-5)
* 1: No sense of physical interaction possibility
* 3: Elements appear somewhat touchable
* 5: Interface elements create compelling illusion of physical manipulation

### Bold Typography Integration (1-5)
* 1: Typography conflicts with dimensional elements
* 3: Typography works but doesn't enhance the clay aesthetic
* 5: Typography perfectly complements and enhances the clay-like elements

### Contrast Management (1-5)
* 1: Harsh contrasts make interface difficult to parse
* 3: Contrast is bold but some elements lack definition
* 5: Perfect balance of bold contrast while maintaining visual harmony

### Raw Aesthetic Integrity (1-5)
* 1: Appears too polished, losing the raw quality
* 3: Some elements maintain raw aesthetic while others appear refined
* 5: Consistently raw aesthetic while maintaining usability

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Clay elements maintain dimension across browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
  - Interactive elements change dimension by at least 2px when activated
  - Typography remains legible at all viewport sizes despite dimensional effects

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Validate affective response ("Does this interface feel friendly/playful?")
  - Test recognition of interactive vs. static elements
  - Measure time-to-first-interaction compared to flat designs

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - <70% of users immediately recognize interactive elements
  - >25% performance degradation on target devices
  - Accessibility testing reveals contrast issues with dimensional effects

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - CSS shadow formulas must be documented for each base color
  - Animation timing functions must be specified for interactive states
  - Responsive breakpoints must include screenshots of dimensional reductions
