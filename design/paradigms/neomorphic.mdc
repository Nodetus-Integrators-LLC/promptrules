# [SOFT SHADOWS, SUBTLE DEPTH]

# Neomorphic Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements with subtle, realistic depth using soft shadows and highlights while maintaining a minimalist appearance
* **Constraint Parameters**: Limited to light color palettes (typically off-whites, light grays); requires precise shadow implementation; avoid excessive depth that breaks the illusion
* **Reference Context**: Apple's iOS widgets (pre-iOS 14), Dribbble neomorphic examples by Alexander Plyuto
* **Edge Case Handling**: For dark modes, invert shadow directions and reduce contrast; for mobile, reduce shadow spread to maintain performance
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Visual cohesion, shadow realism, tactile impression, performance impact of shadow rendering

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Background colors: #E0E5EC, #F0F4F8, #FFFFFF
  - Shadow colors: rgba(0,0,0,0.07) for dark shadows, rgba(255,255,255,0.8) for light highlights
  - Typography: San-serif fonts with medium weight (Nunito, SF Pro, Roboto)
  - Roundness: Border-radius 12px-24px (consistent across elements)

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - Max 3 layered shadows per element
  - Responsive breakpoints maintain shadow proportions relative to element size
  - Progressive enhancement: Fallback to flat design on low-powered devices

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA compliance required
  - Contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 for text
  - Interactive elements must have focus states that preserve neomorphic style

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS-only implementation preferred
  - Framework-agnostic shadow mixins/variables
  - No JavaScript dependency for core visual effects

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If element is interactive → Use inset shadows on press/click
  - If background is > 80% brightness → Use standard shadow values
  - If background is < 80% brightness → Use inverted shadow technique
  - If element contains critical info → Reduce shadow subtlety by 20%

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Functional clarity (element purpose must be obvious)
  2. Performance (shadow complexity must not impact rendering)
  3. Visual consistency with surrounding elements
  4. Depth illusion effect

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Solid color with rounded corners
  - Basic: Single shadow implementation
  - Full: Dual shadows with highlights and pressed states

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Reduce to flat design with subtle border when shadows not supported
  - Use single shadow when device performance is a concern
  - For printing, add thin gray border to indicate dimensionality

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Shadows interfere with readability or usability of elements
* 3: Elements function correctly but shadow effects occasionally distract
* 5: Seamless integration of neomorphic effects that enhance usability through visual affordances

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Shadows create insufficient contrast or visual confusion
* 3: Meets basic accessibility but requires some adjustments for all users
* 5: Fully accessible with enhanced states for focus, hover, and active that maintain the neomorphic style

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Requires complex shadow layering that impacts performance
* 3: Implementation uses optimized shadows but with some complexity
* 5: Elegant implementation with minimal shadow layers and optimized CSS

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Neomorphic effect breaks at different screen sizes
* 3: Maintains effect across most common device sizes with some adjustments
* 5: Fully responsive neomorphic implementation that scales proportionally

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Inconsistent shadow directions or intensities across interface
* 3: Consistent application but with occasional misalignments with light source
* 5: Perfect visual harmony with consistent light source and shadow behavior

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Shadow blur and spread remains proportional across element sizes
  - Click/tap states correctly invert shadows without jarring transition
  - Shadow rendering does not exceed 5ms paint time

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify button affordance is clear without labels
  - Test recognition of interactive vs non-interactive elements
  - Evaluate perceived depth consistency across the interface

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - > 10% of users fail to identify interactive elements
  - Shadow rendering causes frame drops below 60fps
  - Contrast testing fails WCAG AA standards

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Shadow mixin/function with standardized parameters
  - Light source direction diagram for design system
  - Interactive/non-interactive element specification with code examples
