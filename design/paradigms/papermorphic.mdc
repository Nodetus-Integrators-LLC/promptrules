# [TACTILE DEPTH WITH SUBTLE DIMENSION]

# Papermorphic Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces that emulate the tactile nature of paper with subtle shadows and depth, while maintaining digital efficiency and clarity.
* **Constraint Parameters**: Minimal use of gradients, limited shadow complexity, performance-optimized animations, lightweight implementation.
* **Reference Context**: Google Material Design principles with reduced emphasis on motion and increased focus on subtle physicality.
* **Edge Case Handling**: Fallback to flat designs on low-power devices, accessibility modes that reduce shadow effects.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Visual distinction between interactive elements, load performance impact, recognition rate in user testing.

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  * Colors: Primary palette with 50-900 range variations
  * Typography: Clear hierarchical type system with 3-5 distinct sizes
  * Elevation: 0-5 elevation scale with corresponding shadow values
* **Technical Requirements**: 
  * Shadow rendering under 5ms
  * No parallax effects that degrade performance
  * Support for rtl languages and text inflation
* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  * WCAG AA compliance minimum
  * 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text
  * Focus states must be visible without relying solely on shadow effects
* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  * CSS-only shadow implementations when possible
  * Framework-agnostic component specifications
  * No reliance on JavaScript for core visual rendering

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  * If element is interactive → Apply elevation level 1+
  * If element contains other interactive elements → Apply elevation level 0
  * If element is disabled → Remove elevation, apply opacity change
* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  * Performance > Visual fidelity
  * Accessibility > Design consistency
  * Usability > Motion effects
* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  * Base layer: Flat color differentiation for all elements
  * Enhancement: Subtle shadows and hover states
  * Advanced: Micro-interactions and paper-like transitions
* **Fallback Strategy**:
  * Replace shadows with borders when necessary
  * Use color differentiation as alternative to elevation
  * Provide high-contrast mode that eliminates subtle differences

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Shadows/elevations interfere with usability
* 3: Design communicates hierarchy but some interactions lack clarity
* 5: Perfect balance of visual depth cues and functional clarity

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Relies on shadow/depth for critical information
* 3: Accessible but with reduced elegance in high-contrast modes
* 5: Maintains design integrity across all accessibility settings

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Requires complex JS or CSS to achieve paper effects
* 3: Reasonable implementation complexity with some performance impact
* 5: Achieves paper effect with minimal technical overhead

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Design elements break at certain screen sizes
* 3: Adapts to different viewports but with some inconsistencies
* 5: Seamlessly scales from watch to wall display

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Paper metaphor applies inconsistently across components
* 3: Consistent metaphor with occasional awkward implementations
* 5: Paper-like quality feels natural and intentional throughout

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  * Shadow blur radius never exceeds 12px
  * Interactive elements have distinct rest, hover, active, and focus states
  * All text components maintain legibility with or without shadows
* **User Testing Requirements**:
  * Validate depth perception across age demographics
  * Test recognition of interactive elements without hover capability
  * Measure performance impact on target devices
* **Iteration Triggers**:
  * User error rate > 2% when identifying interactive elements
  * Performance degradation > 15% compared to flat design
  * Accessibility complaints regarding contrast or readability
* **Documentation Standards**:
  * Shadow values specified in CSS variables
  * Animation curves defined in functional terms
  * Sample implementations in vanilla HTML/CSS and common frameworks
