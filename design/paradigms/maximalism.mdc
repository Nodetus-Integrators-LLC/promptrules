# MDC Structure: Maximalism Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create rich, complex visuals with abundant details and patterns that create visual impact through density and layering
* **Constraint Parameters**: Must maintain functionality despite visual complexity; ensure text remains readable
* **Reference Context**: Baroque, Memphis Design, Pattern & Decoration movement, Versace aesthetics
* **Edge Case Handling**: Define how to handle limited screen space and mobile adaptations
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Visual impact, cohesive chaos, discoverability of interactive elements

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  * Use full brand color palette including secondary and tertiary colors
  * Mix multiple typefaces across display and body text
  * Voice/tone should be bold, expressive, and confident
* **Technical Requirements**: 
  * Ensure load times remain under 3s despite complex graphics
  * Responsive breakpoints must accommodate dense layouts at all sizes
  * Support for high-resolution displays to show intricate details
* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  * Maintain WCAG AA compliance despite visual complexity
  * Ensure sufficient contrast for text elements (4.5:1 minimum)
  * Provide clear focus indicators within busy backgrounds
* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  * Use CSS for patterns and textures where possible before images
  * Minimize JavaScript dependencies for decorative elements

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  * If content is primary → maintain 30% negative space around it
  * If content is secondary → can be integrated into pattern elements
  * If screen width < 768px → reduce pattern complexity by 40%
* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  * 1. Content legibility
  * 2. Brand expression
  * 3. Visual density
  * 4. Animation/movement
  * 5. Pattern variety
* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  * Core: Bold typography and color contrast
  * Enhanced: Layered patterns and animations
  * Premium: Interactive pattern elements and parallax effects
* **Fallback Strategy**:
  * Replace complex SVG patterns with simpler versions for older browsers
  * Use solid colors instead of gradients where not supported
  * Simplify to key decorative elements only when performance issues arise

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Visual elements obstruct core functionality
* 3: Functions with slight usability challenges due to visual elements
* 5: Maintains perfect functionality while supporting rich visual complexity

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Visual complexity creates significant barriers to access
* 3: Core content is accessible despite surrounding decorative elements
* 5: Maximalist design enhances content hierarchy and improves navigation

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Requires completely custom implementation for each instance
* 3: Uses repeatable patterns but with multiple custom elements
* 5: Achieves complex visual effects through efficient, systematic code

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Design only works for specific content types
* 3: Can be adapted across different content with significant modifications
* 5: Pattern system scales across diverse applications while maintaining maximalist aesthetic

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Elements clash in discordant ways that feel unintentional
* 3: High visual density but with some competing focal points
* 5: Creates "coherent chaos" where all elements form an intentional composition

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  * Users can locate primary CTAs within 3 seconds despite busy backgrounds
  * Page load performance remains under 3 seconds on standard connections
  * All text achieves minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds
* **User Testing Requirements**:
  * Test with users on various devices including low-end mobile
  * Evaluate cognitive load through task completion time compared to standard interfaces
  * Validate emotional response aligns with brand personality goals
* **Iteration Triggers**:
  * Task completion rates drop below 85%
  * Load times exceed 3 seconds
  * User feedback indicates visual fatigue
* **Documentation Standards**:
  * Pattern library with composition guidelines
  * Layer management best practices
  * Performance optimization techniques for complex visuals
