# [DEPTH THROUGH CONSTRAINT]

# Design Paradigm: Monochroism
*Single-color palettes with varying shades for depth*

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create visual hierarchy and cohesion using a single base color with mathematical variations in saturation and luminance to provide depth and focus without color contrast.
* **Constraint Parameters**: Limit palette to a single hue with at least 5 tint/shade variations; maintain sufficient contrast ratios between adjacent shades (minimum 3:1 for text).
* **Reference Context**: See Google Material Design monochromatic palette generation, IBM Carbon Design System color ramps.
* **Edge Case Handling**: For interactive elements, ensure hover/focus states have minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against background; use texture or subtle patterns when additional visual separation is needed.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Success measured by maintained hierarchy, readability, and visual interest despite color constraints.

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Base color: [HEX VALUE]
  - Shade generation algorithm: [ALGORITHM DETAILS]
  - Typography weight variation: Increase font weight by 200 units to compensate for reduced color contrast
* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - Generate color variants using HSL model for predictable luminance steps
  - Support for high contrast mode with increased luminance differences
  - Responsive adjustments: Increase contrast on smaller viewports
* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA compliant (minimum 4.5:1 contrast for normal text)
  - Test with grayscale filters to validate perceptible contrast
  - Include alternative visual indicators (icons, patterns) for color-blind users
* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Define colors as CSS custom properties with clear naming convention
  - Provide SCSS/LESS mixins for shade generation
  - Implement with standard color values, not dependent on specific frameworks

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If element is primary action → Use darkest/most saturated shade
  - If element is background → Use lightest shade
  - If element indicates hierarchy level → Use shade based on numeric position in hierarchy
  
* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Accessibility (contrast) requirements
  2. Functional clarity (distinguishable UI elements)
  3. Aesthetic balance
  4. Animation/transition effects
  
* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Static monochromatic palette
  - Enhancement: Subtle gradient transitions between shades
  - Enhancement: Micro-interactions with luminance shifts
  
* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - When contrast insufficient: Add subtle border or shadow
  - When differentiation needed: Introduce pattern/texture variation
  - When emphasis required: Use size or weight variation instead of color

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Elements not distinguishable from each other
* 3: Elements distinguishable but hierarchy not immediately clear
* 5: Clear visual hierarchy and functionality despite monochromatic constraint

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Fails contrast requirements for text readability
* 3: Meets minimum contrast requirements but challenging for some users
* 5: Excellent readability with thoughtful alternatives to color-based indicators

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Requires custom implementation for each element
* 3: Systematized but with numerous exceptions
* 5: Elegant implementation with mathematical color generation and consistent application

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Works only for simple interfaces
* 3: Adaptable to complex interfaces with some modifications
* 5: Robust system that scales to any interface complexity

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Appears flat and undifferentiated
* 3: Serviceable depth but lacks visual interest
* 5: Sophisticated visual depth with elegant shade transitions

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - All text elements maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio with backgrounds
  - Primary actions distinguishable from secondary actions without color discrimination
  - Interface remains navigable when viewed in grayscale
  
* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Test with color blind users
  - Test comprehension of hierarchy without prior explanation
  - Measure time-to-task completion compared to polychromatic interfaces
  
* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - User error rate exceeds 5% for common tasks
  - Negative feedback specifically mentioning difficulty distinguishing elements
  - Heat map shows user confusion/searching
  
* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Complete shade reference with context-specific usage guidelines
  - Color function documentation for dynamic shade generation
  - Illustrative examples of correct/incorrect implementations
